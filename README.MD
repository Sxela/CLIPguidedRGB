# CLIP is all you need (c) [crumb](https://twitter.com/aicrumb)
Greatly inspired by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/aicrumb/status/1448351059957764096/photo/1) and all the CLIP guided approaches.

What if we directly optimize raw image tensor using CLIP, instead of tuning a generator network or its inputs? 
Just like style transfer algos were doing 5 yeras ago :D

This is a place for all my hacks on this topic. Feel free to mess around :D
